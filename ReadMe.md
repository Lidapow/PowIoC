#PowIoC

An Inversion of Control (Dependency Injection) for Unity3D.
This library utilize ScriptableObject of Unity3D to descript mapping relation.

The main purpose is no need to recompile source code, when there just have some dependency changed.

Following snippet is the dependency settings, which stored in a asset file.
You can edit it in Inspector window, even in a text editor.

Due to the binding data isn't source code, so the data also can be changed, even your application was built.

```YAML
  bind:
  - bind: SomeData
    to: SomeData
    scope: 
    note: 
  - bind: ICommand
    to: CommandA
    scope: PurposeA
    note: 
  - bind: ICommand
    to: CommandB
    scope: PurposeB
    note: 
  - bind: ILogger
    to: UnityLogger
    scope: 
    note: 
```

Following code shows how to mark fields which needs inject, and can pass parameter to set the scope and non-singleton.

```C#
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using PowIoC;

public class MyComponent : MonoBehaviour {
	[Inject]
	SomeData data; 

	[Inject("PurposeA")]
	ICommand cmdA;
	[Inject("PurposeB")]
	ICommand cmdB;

	[Inject(false)]
	ILogger logger;

	void Awake () {
		Injector.Inject(this);
	}
}
```
